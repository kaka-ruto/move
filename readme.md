## Native

Using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started) for native builds

### Prepare native builds

## iOS testing and distribution
1. Download latest Xcode
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add ios`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open ios` Xcode takes a few minutes to index the files; keep an eye at the top of Xcode's window for progress.

[Not compulsory] For sanity check click on the play button in top left. This will prepare and run the app in a simulator, if all goes well you should be able to login and click around. If not, create an issue ðŸ¤· and I will have a look.

*Icons and launch images* - Xcode (v11.5) cannot map icons listed in config.xml so this has to be done manually ðŸ˜ž. In the root folder look for Resources and select Images.xcassets. A panel will show up where you can select AppIcon to add app icons or LaunchImage to add launch images.

## Android testing and distribution
1. Download latest Android Studio
2. `npm run build`
3. `npx cap add android`
3. `npx cap copy`
4. `npx cap open android` Android Studio takes a few minutes to index the files, keep an eye at the bottom of Android Studio for progress.
5. Testing - When indexing is complete, look for a green play button. Click the play button and it will launch the app in an emulator ([See here to setup Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)) or on the phone if a phone is connected via USB.

## Disclaimer
Ionic Vue is still in beta; I am using this setup in production but please use with caution. Keep an eye on [Ionic Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Ionicframework), [forum](https://forum.ionicframework.com/) and [slack group](https://ionic-worldwide.slack.com) for updates, RCs and production release expected towards the end of the year.
